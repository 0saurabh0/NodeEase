# NodeEase

**NodeEase** is an open-source platform that makes it effortless to deploy and manage your own **Solana RPC nodes** on AWS and Bare Metal(soon) — with full control, transparency, and zero vendor lock-in.

>  Build your own RPC — provision, monitor, and destroy Solana infrastructure from a beautiful web UI, backed by Go and Terraform.


## Why NodeEase?

Running your own Solana RPC node is powerful but intimidating:
- It’s complicated to set up
- Cloud costs feel unpredictable
- Managed providers are convenient but opaque

**NodeEase changes that.**

Instead of relying on costly managed RPC services (that lock you into their platform), **NodeEase gives you your own fully controllable RPC node**, on infrastructure **you own and trust**.

> Ideal for **developers**, **validators**, and **infra teams** who want transparency, cost-efficiency, and decentralization.
